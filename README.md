### Introduction

This is FPGA project for surveillance applications.User needs 2 RGGBers for this. Download the project in HDMI_CIS_colorbar_1920x1080 folder to RGGBer controlled by Android App. And download the project in HDMI_CIS_1920x1080 folder to another.

In current rev.3 hardware, user still needs [MCU project](https://github.com/rggber/rggber-mcu-prj) for configurations and wireless control. But in rev.4 which will be deliverable version, both MCU and FPGA can do all of those.
